## Task Log

### Task 1 — Backend scaffold + health endpoint ✅
**Implemented:** Django 5.2.1 project (`config`) + `api` app on Python 3.12 venv. Settings read from `.env` (secret key, debug, hosts, CORS, `ORS_API_KEY`). DRF + corsheaders + whitenoise wired. `GET /api/health/` → `{"status":"ok"}`. `pytest.ini` + passing `tests/test_health.py`. `.gitignore`, `.env` (gitignored, holds ORS key), `.env.example`.
**Test:** `pytest tests/test_health.py` → 1 passed.
**Remaining:** Tasks 2–14. Next: HOS types + rule constants (Task 2).

### Task 2 — HOS types + rule constants ✅
**Implemented:** `backend/hos/` pure module (no Django). `rules.py` — all FMCSA constants (11h drive, 14h window, 8h→30min break, 10h reset, 70h cycle, 34h restart) + trip assumptions (1h pickup/dropoff, fuel/1000mi, 55mph fallback) + duty-status names. `types.py` — `Segment` (with `duration_hours()`), `Stop`, `DayLog`, `Violation`, `TripPlan` dataclasses.
**Test:** `pytest tests/test_hos_types.py` → 1 passed.
**Remaining:** Tasks 3–14. Next: HOS engine single-day path (Task 3).

### Task 3 — HOS engine single-day ✅
**Implemented:** `hos/engine.py` `build_timeline(...)`. Walks the trip with a `_Builder` cursor: pickup on-duty (1h) → driving broken into chunks bounded by next-break and next-fuel boundaries → dropoff on-duty (1h). Inserts a 30-min on-duty break after 8h cumulative driving and a fuel stop every 1,000 mi. Emits matching `Stop`s (pickup/fuel/break/dropoff). Multi-day resets/cycle deferred to Task 4 (single-day path leaves violations empty).
**Test:** `pytest tests/test_hos_engine_singleday.py` → 2 passed.
**Remaining:** Tasks 4–14. Next: multi-day resets + 70h cycle + 34h restart (Task 4).

### Task 4 — HOS engine multi-day resets + cycle + restart ✅
**Implemented:** Rewrote the driving loop with checks-at-top: 70h cycle → 34h off-duty restart (+ informational `Violation`); 11h drive limit / 14h window → 10h off-duty reset; 8h driving → 30-min break; 1000mi → fuel. Driving chunks bounded by all five limits so each stop lands exactly on its boundary. Tracks `drive_today`, `drive_since_break`, `window_start`, rolling `cycle_used` (seeded from input + pickup).
**Test:** full suite `pytest tests/` → 7 passed (10h-reset, 34h-restart, fuel, single-day, types, health).
**Remaining:** Tasks 5–14. Next: split timeline into per-day log sheets (Task 5).

### Task 5 — Split timeline into per-day log sheets ✅
**Implemented:** `split_into_days(segments)` cuts any segment that runs past midnight and groups them into `DayLog`s with per-status totals (off/sleeper/driving/on-duty). Segments ending exactly at midnight stay in their start day (no zero-length pieces). `build_timeline` now populates `TripPlan.days`. Corrected the day test to assert the real within-day invariant (start on day, end ≤ next midnight) instead of the buggy date-equality check.
**Test:** full suite → 8 passed.
**Remaining:** Tasks 6–14. Next: OpenRouteService client (Task 6).

### Task 6 — OpenRouteService client ✅
**Implemented:** `api/services/ors.py` — `geocode(query)` → {label,lat,lng} (first feature) and `route(coords)` → {distance_miles, duration_hours, geometry:[[lat,lng]]} via driving-hgv GeoJSON. Key from `settings.ORS_API_KEY`, never client-exposed. `ORSError` on failures. ORS returns [lng,lat]; we flip to [lat,lng] for Leaflet.
**Test:** mocked `pytest tests/test_ors.py` → 2 passed. Live smoke test with real key confirmed (Chicago→Des Moines 334mi/7.8h).
**Remaining:** Tasks 7–14. Next: Trip/Stop/LogDay models + migrations (Task 7).

### Task 7 — Trip/Stop/LogDay models + migrations ✅
**Implemented:** `api/models.py` — `Trip` (locations, cycle_used_hrs, totals, route_geometry JSON, created_at), `Stop` (FK related_name=stops, type/label/mile_marker/lat/lng/arrival/departure), `LogDay` (FK related_name=days, date, segments JSON, totals JSON). Migration `0001_initial` generated + applied.
**Test:** `pytest tests/test_models.py` → 1 passed.
**Remaining:** Tasks 8–14. Next: create-trip endpoint + serializers (Task 8).

### Task 8 — Create-trip endpoint + serializers ✅
**Implemented:** `POST /api/trips/` geocodes the 3 locations, routes current→pickup→dropoff (ORS), derives `pickup_offset_miles` from leg 0, runs `build_timeline`, persists `Trip`+`Stop`s+`LogDay`s, returns full JSON (route, stops, days, violations). `GET /api/trips/<id>/` re-loads a saved trip. Stops without coords get interpolated along the geometry. Serializers: `TripInputSerializer` (validation, cycle 0–70), `TripSerializer`/`StopSerializer`/`LogDaySerializer`. Added `Trip.violations` JSON field (migration 0002). Also extended `ors.route` to return per-leg distances.
**Test:** full suite → 14 passed (create 201 + round-trip GET, validation 400).
**Remaining:** Tasks 9–14 (frontend + deploy). Next: frontend scaffold (Task 9).

### Task 9 — Frontend scaffold + Tailwind + shadcn-style UI + API client ✅
**Implemented:** Vite React+TS app in `frontend/`. Tailwind v3 (dark theme, glassmorphism tokens, indigo/cyan gradient bg), `@` path alias (vite + tsconfig), Vitest (jsdom + jest-dom setup). shadcn-style primitives hand-written (`ui/button|card|input|label`) using cva + tailwind-merge (avoids CLI interactivity). `lib/types.ts` mirrors API JSON; `lib/api.ts` `createTrip`/`getTrip` (base from `VITE_API_BASE_URL`). Deps: react-leaflet, leaflet, jspdf, html2canvas, lucide-react. `.env`/`.env.example`.
**Test:** `vitest run src/lib/api.test.ts` → 2 passed.
**Remaining:** Tasks 10–14. Next: TripForm component (Task 10).

### Task 10 — TripForm component ✅
**Implemented:** `components/TripForm.tsx` — glass card with 4 icon-labeled fields (current/pickup/dropoff/cycle), client validation (locations required, cycle 0–70), loading state with spinner, submits typed `TripInput`. Fixed vite alias to use `import.meta.url` (ESM `__dirname` was undefined) so `@/` resolves in Vitest. Renamed cycle label to avoid `/current/i` collision in tests.
**Test:** `vitest run TripForm` → 2 passed.
**Remaining:** Tasks 11–14. Next: EldLogSheet SVG (Task 11).

### Task 11 — EldLogSheet SVG ✅
**Implemented:** `components/EldLogSheet.tsx` — DOT-style daily log: 24 hour columns (Mid/Noon/major ticks) × 4 duty rows (Off/Sleeper/Driving/On-Duty), duty-status polyline plotted from segment times (UTC frac-hour → x, status → row), right-column per-status hour totals, remarks row with location ticks. One sheet per `DayLog`, day N of M header.
**Test:** `vitest run EldLogSheet` → 1 passed (renders rows + polyline).
**Remaining:** Tasks 12–14. Next: Leaflet RouteMap + animated playback (Task 12).

### Task 12 — RouteMap (Leaflet) + animated playback ✅
**Implemented:** `components/RouteMap.tsx` — react-leaflet map (Carto dark tiles), route polyline, color-coded stop markers (pickup/dropoff/fuel/rest/break divIcons) with popups, auto-fit bounds. rAF truck (🚚) playback along geometry with play/pause, live driving-hours clock, miles counter, progress bar, and a legend. Whole trip animates over ~14s.
**Test:** `vitest run RouteMap` (react-leaflet mocked) → 1 passed (polyline + play control).
**Remaining:** Tasks 13–14. Next: ViolationBanner + TripDashboard + PDF + dark polish (Task 13).
